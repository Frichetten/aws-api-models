# aws-api-models
A collection of documented and undocumented AWS API models.

To learn how this dataset was compiled don't miss "Hidden Among the Clouds: A Look at Undocumented AWS APIs", September 17th at [fwd:cloudsec EU 2024](https://fwdcloudsec.org/conference/europe/).

I've been working on a tool for to extract AWS API service models from the AWS console. I've gone through a number of these looking for bugs but ultimately there were too many for me to do by hand. I'm publishing this dataset for the security community to look through for potential issues. Operations with `internalonly: true` are a great place to start.
