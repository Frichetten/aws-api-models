# aws-api-models
A collection of documented and undocumented AWS API models.

I've been working on a tool for a few months to extract AWS API service models from the AWS console. I've gone through a number of these looking for bugs but ultimately there were too many for me to do by hand. I'm publishing this dataset for the security community to look through for potential issues. Operations with `internalonly: true` is a great place to start.
